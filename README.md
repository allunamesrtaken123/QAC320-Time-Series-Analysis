# QAC320-Time-Series-Analysis
For this course, I took a Kaggle dataset of soccer match odds movement over time, clustered the 
time series, modeled the medoids of each cluster, and ran basic demographics to discern patterns 
behind which matches fell into which clusters.

The code and data can be used to replicate the analysis, and the final report is a more formal
write up of the project.
